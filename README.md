Decision Tree on Iris Dataset

This project implements a Decision Tree classifier to classify flowers in the Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 samples representing three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.


Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to enhance my understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) and classification algorithms. By exploring Decision Trees, I am learning how to code in Python and gaining insights into the mechanics of supervised learning.


Decision Tree Classifier

A Decision Tree is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It models decisions and their possible consequences as a tree-like structure. Each internal node represents a feature (or attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome (class label).
Using the Iris dataset, the Decision Tree algorithm learns patterns in the data to classify unseen samples based on the feature values. This approach allows for easy interpretation of the model's decisions, making it a valuable tool for understanding classification processes.


Learning Process

Through this project, I am developing practical skills in implementing machine learning algorithms, specifically in the context of supervised learning. Working with Decision Trees offers a foundational understanding of how models can make predictions based on data-driven decisions. This experience will serve as a stepping stone for more complex AI concepts in the future.
